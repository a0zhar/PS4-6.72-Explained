### `trigger function`
 - The value of `x` thats used when calling trigger function in the `exploit.js`
   Looks like following:
```json
{
  THE target STRUCTURE:
  "a": {
    "a": 2.1100820415101592e-303,
    "b": false,
    "c": true,
    "d": 5678
  },
  THIS IS GENERATED BY THE create_impl
  FUNCTION. IT INCREASES BY 32 NEW EACH 
  IDERATION:
  "0x": {},
  "1x": {},
  "2x": {},
  "3x": {},
   ...
  "32x": {}
}
```
